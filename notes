REGISTRATION SCRIPT: connect script php "register.php" with form "registration.php"
- Create a file "register.php" in which there will be a script responsible for entering the data of a new user into the database.
- Merge the "registration.php" file in such a way that submitting the form will launch the "register.php" script. 
- If you return to the form, the fields "login", "password" and input "term of servcies" will be automatically filled in with the previously entered data.


Also:
- In the "registration.php" file, change the link from "loginform.html" to "loginform.php".
- In the "index.php" file, when the user is logged in - next to the avatar, the user's email address will be displayed instead of the caption "You are logged".
- In the "registration.php" file, I added an option to indicate acceptance of the terms of the services.
