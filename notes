Prepare the structure for writing php scripts. 
In order to create: 
- database connection, 
- the ability to create an account and log in

Also: 
- create "SQL" folder for databases
- change conversion ".kit" files for ".php" insead ".html"
- change anchor addresses in navigation 
- As of now, I can no longer use liveServer to preview the site. From now on, I can access the site locally by using XAMPP and going to "http://localhost/accountingApp"
