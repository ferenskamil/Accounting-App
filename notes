-   The user will be able to upload his own photo and serve it as an avatar of his profile.
-   The photo must not be larger than 3mb.
-   The photo can have formats only ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png".
-   The new name of the photo will be inserted into the database.
-   The script will be run every time a photo is selected via fileinput.
-   The uploaded photo will be automatically saved in the folder "dist/img/avatars/".
